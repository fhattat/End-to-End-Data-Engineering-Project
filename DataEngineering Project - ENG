However, in a real **Big Data** project, **CSV is never used in the Gold layer; Parquet (or Delta) is used.** The reasons are as follows:\n","\n","**Speed (Column-Based Reading):**\n","\n","* **CSV:** It is row-based. Even if you only want to sum the \"Revenue\" column, the computer has to read the entire row (Customer name, City, etc.). It is slow.\n","* **Parquet:** It is column-based. If you say sum \"Revenue\", it reads only that column and ignores the others. It is 100 times faster on massive data.\n","\n","**Data Type Preservation (Schema):**\n","\n","* **CSV:** Everything is text (string). Whether it is a date, number, or text is lost. The computer has to guess when reading it again.\n","* **Parquet:** It saves the data type inside itself. Information like \"This column is a date, this column is a decimal number\" is inside the file. It eliminates the risk of making errors.\n","\n","**Compression (Size):**\n","\n","* Parquet files take up 70-80% less space compared to CSV.
